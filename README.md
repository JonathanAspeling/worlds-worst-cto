# The CTO Leadership Self-Assessment

An interactive web application for technology leaders to honestly assess their leadership tendencies under pressure.

## Overview

This is a brutally honest, 20-question assessment designed to surface how CTOs and technology leaders actually think about leadership when systems fail, timelines slip, engineers disagree, and executives demand simple answers to complex problems.

The assessment is written like a Cosmopolitan quiz for people who run technology at scale. Every option is phrased to sound reasonable, responsible, and professionally defensible. That's the point. The wrong answers are rarely stupid - they are seductive.

## Features

- **Landing Page**: Comprehensive explanation of the assessment with clear scoring indicators
- **Interactive Question Flow**: 20 questions presented one at a time with smooth transitions
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress indicator showing current question and total
- **Automatic Scoring**: Instant calculation of results across three leadership categories
- **Detailed Results**:
  - Score summary with percentages for each category
  - Personalized interpretation based on results
  - Complete breakdown showing all questions with your answers highlighted
  - Full explanations for each option (what makes it attractive vs. what it creates)
- **Mobile-First Design**: Fully responsive layout optimized for all devices
- **No Build Required**: Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - just open index.html

## Scoring Categories

- **🟢 Durable Leadership**: Builds long-term capability, speed, and resilience
- **🟡 Context Dependent**: Reasonable sometimes, dangerous as a default
- **🔴 Fragile Leadership**: Optimizes for optics, control, and personal safety

## About the Assessment

The most dangerous leaders are not incompetent. They are reassuring.

This assessment helps technology leaders recognize the difference between leadership that looks good in the moment and leadership that builds durable, resilient organizations. Each question presents four options that all sound professionally defensible - because that's how these decisions actually present themselves in the real world.

Answer honestly. Not as the leader you describe in interviews. As the leader you become when pressure arrives and incentives collide with reality.
